# SketchUp import .bim
A simple SketchUp Ruby extension to import the .bim file format (see https://dotbim.net/).

# Installation instructions

## Method 1 (Extension manager)
Install from the SketchUp `Extension Manager` (Under `Extensions > Extension Manager` in the menu bar) using the `mb_import_dotbim.rbz` file.

Note that a `.rbz` file its just a `.zip` with a different name.

## Method 2 (By hand)
Copy the `mb_import_dotbim.rb` file and the `mb_import_dotbim` folder in the SketchUp Plugins folder located at `C:\Users\<YOUR_USERNAME>\AppData\Roaming\SketchUp\SketchUp 2022\SketchUp\Plugins`.

Note that you could take the file and the folder of method 2, compress them in a `mb_import_dotbim.zip` folder, rename it to `mb_import_dotbim.rbz` and use method 1.

# How to see the metadata
You can use an extension like Attribute Inspector by Aerilius (you find it on the Extension Warehouse at https://extensions.sketchup.com/extension/2c7d7254-76eb-40af-9897-bc7d16b42fb6/attribute-inspector)

Enjoy!
